    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Started a software company that focuses in facilitating
      the processes of notaries. It brings technology to an area
      that has been left behind in the bureaucracy of Mexico.
      We help notaries move to a digital era and make their
      processes more efficient. As part of our continuous effort
      to bring transparency, we integrate our software with all
      the actors in the notary process. These includes banks,
      construction companies, legal offices and the government.
      This way all the parties involved have a single platform
      for the whole process from beginning to end.
